 <h2> Task - Build a Weather Forecast Dashboard </h2>
 Using OpenWeather One Call API we were to fetch the data from city forecasts and append them to the page.
 It needed to display the current and future conditions; with the date, an icon of weather conditions, tempature, humidity, wind and UV index.
 The UV index needs a color code to represent whether the conditions are favorable (green) moderate (yellow) or severe (red)
